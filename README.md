# MAMBA
This code accompanies the paper "[Scalable Multi-Agent Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15023)".

The repository contains MAMBA implementation as well as fine-tuned hyperparameters in ```configs/dreamer/optimal``` folder.

## Installation

`python3.7` is required

```
pip install wheel
pip install flatland-2.2.2/
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Installing Starcraft:

https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac#installing-starcraft-ii


## Usage

```
python3 train.py --n_workers 2 --env flatland --env_type 5_agents
```

Two environments are supported for env flag: flatland and starcraft.
